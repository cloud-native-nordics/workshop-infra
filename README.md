### Workshop Infrastructure

For Cloud Native Nordics workshops. This first one is specific to Kubernetes Finland,

workshop with an unique web-based VS Code environment per attendee.

The workshop slide deck is [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LJCqZjm5aGFypoZ4fG-ELBe0tcK6pfcN7H8qIrh6pIU/edit#slide=id.g55108ecb85_0_162)
